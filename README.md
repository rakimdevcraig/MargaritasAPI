Margaritas API
This app lets you find Margarita recipes with the click of a button. We list the name of the drink along with
the ingredients and directions so if it looks enticing you can try it for yourself!

How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, API

This project was created with the thecocktaildb's API. After making an ajax request to the site if it was successful I would take the image by using the attr method, I would print the drink name to an h1 by using the .html and I had h2's to print out what to consume the beverage in and whether the beverage was alcoholic or not.
I also had a list that the ingredients would be appended or added to and lastly I printed the instructions to a paragraph at the bottom of the page.

Lessons Learned:
This assignment really demonstrates the importance of having structure in a webpage. I took in alot of info about each drink and if it didn't have structure to it than the info would be printed all over the place and annoy the user. At first I had the ingredients print out right under the image but I realized that wouldn't make sense to read ingredients for a drink you might possibly not like. That led me to putting the image uptop then drink name below so users can check the name and continue to read if it seems like something they like instead of having to read info about something they might've already drank and don't like.

Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
